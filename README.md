# StipeMatrix  
A simple and educational Python matrix library implemented from scratch.

StipeMatrix is a lightweight, pure-Python library designed for learning and understanding matrix operations without relying on NumPy.  
It is ideal for students, developers, and anyone who wants to understand the internals of linear algebra and matrix manipulation.

## ✨ Features

✔ Basic matrix operations (`+`, `-`, `*`)  
✔ Scalar multiplication  
✔ Transpose  
✔ Determinant (2×2, 3×3, general recursive)  
✔ Inverse matrices  
✔ Gauss–Jordan elimination (RREF)  
✔ Solve linear systems (Ax = b)  
✔ Matrix rank  
✔ Trace  
✔ Symmetry check  
✔ Orthogonality check  
✔ Horizontal & vertical matrix stacking  
✔ Random matrix generators (int & float)  
✔ Diagonal & scalar matrices  
✔ File save/load support  
✔ Utility helpers (list → matrix, vector → list)  

Everything is implemented **from scratch in pure Python**, clean and easy to understand.
